                <p class="news-date">Feb 18th, 2024</p>
                <p class="news-summary">The School of Computer Science successfully hosted the WINHACKS Competition on Sunday, February, 2024.

                    WinHacks was first created four years ago, but due to the global pandemic, it was hosted online. In 2024, the event was held in-person for the first time during reading week. Tech enthusiasts can work together, make new ideas, and find solutions to practical issues at hackathons. Future developers can use it as a means of networking with businesses and investigating potential career paths. Maintaining WinHacks' success in the coming years requires us to keep funding local talent in the computer industry.

The turnout was fantastic, with attendees enjoying a lively atmosphere filled with laughter, friendly competition, and good vibes all around. From intense chess matches to casual games like mafia and cup pong, there was something for everyone to enjoy. 

                    The java lounge was transformed with fun LED colors and fairy lights, turning the java lounge into a lively venue. However, what truly made the night special was the opportunity for attendees, especially first-year students, to connect with fellow CS peers. These events go beyond just having fun; they're also about building relationships and creating lasting memories with fellow first-year students! People were laughing over games, while others just hung out, chatting and making new friends. It was a fun evening for everyone!
